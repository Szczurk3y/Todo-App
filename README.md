# Todo App
Fully written in Kotlin. 
For caching data I've used room pattern, therefore if user opens an app without internet connection the app will download todos from cache.
I implemented api requests basically using kotlin coroutines and RxKotlin library.
App's architecture is MVVM with Koin as dependency injection.
