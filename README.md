# Todo App
Fully written in Kotlin. 
For caching data I use room pattern, therefore if user opens an app it will download todos from cache.
I implemented api requests basically using kotlin coroutines and RxKotlin.
App's architecture is MVVM with Koin as dependency injection.

# Delete
swipe item left/right

# Add
click floating button 

# Update
click on existing item
 
# Sorting
You can sort all todos by:
- title
- insertion
- deadline
